# patternlab
This repo will have all the codes for our Pattern Recognition Lab university course.

# Demo
To have a demo of the current progress in a more presentable way, check out the Project_demo.ipynb file.

# Links
These are the links provided in the class and will be used all throughout the course.

1. Implementing word2vec: https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-word2vec-in-pytorch-skip-gram-model-e6bae040d2fb

## Work Distribution
- [x] Grasp the ideas written in the 1st link. The article needs to be read by everyone and in case of difficulty, contact @rifazn
- [ ] Implement the code from the 1st link as much as possible by ourselves in a manner that maximises our understanding of the topics (by doing research in between, not just code)
    - [x] Find the right probabilities of every center,context pair (in form of P(context|center)) (Almost done)
    - [ ] Make word2idx and idx2word arrays, so they can be passed to 'torch'
